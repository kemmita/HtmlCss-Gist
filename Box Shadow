1. Box Shadow allows you to add shadow effect to your elements. If you choose to use this, you may consider using the 
css selector transform and the css function translateY, you can add a bit of an effect to the element that is having
a shadow appended.


.btn:hover {
    transform: translateY(-3px);
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,.2);
}
