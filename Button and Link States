1. The initial state you will want to style is link and visited as this is how the button or link will appear when it is not interacted 
with or has already been selected once.

.btn:link,
.btn:visited {
    text-decoration: none;
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 100px;
    transition: all .2s;
}


2. The hover states is self explanitory

.btn:hover {
    transform: translateY(-3px);
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,.2);
}


3. The active state is for how the button rects to a click

.btn:active {
    transform: translateY(-1px);
    box-shadow: 0px 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.2);
}
