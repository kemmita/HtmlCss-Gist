1. From the code below we can gather that the input class is a flex item as it is utilizing the flex-basis or shorthand "flex"
the search element is taking up 40% of the original flex-container. Inside of this flex item we have more items that need to be aligned, 
so we will know need to make this flex item into a flex container, both can be done at the same time.

.search {
  // flex item code
  flex: 0 0 40%;
  
  //flex container code.
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  }
