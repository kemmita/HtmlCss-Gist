<!--we will now start using the grid system we downloaded before. We are nested in our main section but not nested within a main container 
div. we want our grids to be centered so make sure all grid items are placed in a new div with our pre defined class row. Now, inside 
create an additional div with the class name col "col" was declared in the grid css file we downloaded so that is where we are getting
that from. we will be utilizing 4 rows so we assign this div span 1-of-4 if you were going to have 3 rows it would be 1-of-3 just check 
the grid css file for verification. each column will be 23.8% if you multiply that by 4 you will hit 100% sometimes the gird bodys can
look a bit to close so we can add a word to class, we call ours box-->
