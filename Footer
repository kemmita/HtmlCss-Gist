To keep a footer glued to the bottom of the page use css property bottom and set it to 0 like so

.footer{
	text-align: center;
	position: absolute;
	bottom: 0;
	width: 100%;
}


also make sure that html is set to 
/*html must have position relative so we can give our footer a position absolute.*/
html{
	position: relative;
	min-height: 100%;
}
