this was needed for css query because nackground videos cannot be played on mobile
we use the body selector and use an image from the net. no-repeat center center fixed keeps it 
in the right place but it is	background-size: cover; that refits the size of the image to the phone.

	body{
    background: url(images/stefanus-martanto-setyo-husodo-18382.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;
		background-size: cover;
		
		
}
