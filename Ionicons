to use ionicons go to http://ionicons.com/ and download the file inside of that file we will need 2 files the first will be 
ionicons.min.css place that into a css folder preferably a vendor css folder 
place this in your header <link rel="stylesheet" href="Vendors/css/ionicons.min.css">

place this in your body 
<i class="ion-ios-infinite-outline"></i>

you will get the class name from the website, when you find a logo you like, hover and it will show you the icon code.
