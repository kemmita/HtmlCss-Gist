1. Navigate to your program file and open the terminal in this location.
2. Run command "npm init" this will create a package.json file
3. Run command "npm install node-sass --save-dev"
4. Setup is now done lets now see how to compile the sass code.
5. In the same file higharchy create new directory called sass
6. Within the sass directory create a new file called main.scss
7. Go to package.json and find the "scripts" section. Create a script that will compile the sass code on command.

  "scripts": {
    "c:s": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css -w"
  },
 
8. Run the command "npm run c:s" notice how the c:s is what we defined above in our script.
9. You should see a success msg "Rendering Complete"
10. Optional, but awesome :) open up another terminal while the sass terminal is still running and 
run command "npm install live-server -g"
11. Then run command "live-server" if you do not have both terminals running, it will not work.
