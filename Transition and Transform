1. If we want to add some type of animation to an element you will need to use the css transition property within the initial css state of
the element. 


.btn:link,
.btn:visited {
    border-radius: 100px;
    transition: all .2s;
}


2. Now we can add the transform property within the hover selector.



.btn:hover {
    transform: translateY(-3px);
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,.2);
}


3. If we wanr to transition many different properties within the element, we can use all for the transition duration or we can seperate
the properties and append values such as ease to hold off on the transition until the other has finished


button {
  height: 9rem;
  width: 29rem;
  font-size: 2.8rem;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  background-color: blue;
  //we will change the background-color over the duration of 5s. if we want the width to run after that is complete, we 
  //can use "ease 5s" You can see that we wait until the width is done to transition the border-radius
  transition: background-color 5s, color .2s, width 10s ease 5s,
              border-radius 2s ease-in-out 10s;
}

button:hover{
  background-color: green;
  color: #000;
  width: 60rem;
  border-radius: 12%;
}
