1. transform translate is used to move the element on the y axis or on the x axis. You can declare both at the same time, or individually
as I do below.

img{
  margin-top: 20rem;
  display: block;
  transition: all 2s;
}
//the image will move -15 rem on the y axis, making the image appear as if it is moving to the top of the screen.
img:hover{
  transform:  translateY(-15rem);
}
