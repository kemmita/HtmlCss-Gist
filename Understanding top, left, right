1. The parent element is already set to position relative and I will not show that code below.

2. Using position absoulte in this case will result in us having our element displayed to the top right corner. We want to position our
element for where it should lie in relation to the parent elements dimensions.

 .popup__close:link, .popup__close:visited {
    color: #777;
    position: absolute;
    font-size: 3rem;
    top: 0; // This will sit at the exact top that was given to us, keeping in mind the parents design dimensions.
    right: 1.5rem; // from the right we will have 15px margin pushing it off the right side of the parent element.
    text-decoration: none;
    display: inline-block;
    transition: all .2s; 
    }
