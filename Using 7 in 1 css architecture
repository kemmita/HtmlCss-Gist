1. 7 in i is a architecure usded to split up you sass code and make it more maintainable. The first and most important file lies within
the main sass direcotry and this file is called main.scss. Within main.scss we will include all of our imports.

// main.scss

@import "abstracts/functions";
@import "abstracts/mixins";
@import "abstracts/variables";

@import "base/animations";
@import "base/base";
@import "base/typography";
@import "base/utilities";

@import "components/button";

@import "layout/header";

@import "pages/home";

2. Using "base/animations" import for example, we will create a new directory nested within sass and name it base, within base we will 
create a new file called animations.scss all of the animations for this application will be stored in this file and than processed in
main.scss using the @import decleration.

// animations.scss

@keyframes moveInLeft{
  0%{
      opacity: 0;
      transform: translateX(-10rem);
  }
  80%{
      transform: translateX(1rem)
  }
  100%{
      opacity: 1;
      transform: translateX(0);
  }
}
