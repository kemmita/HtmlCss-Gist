1. In our mixin file we will create a mixin and use if statements to help us jump from screen size to screen size.

// 1em = 16px, we must use em for media queries. If we have a max width of 600px, we would do 600 / 16 = 37.5em so divide all px by 16
// It does matter whic order these are placed, you will want to place the smaller px queries twoards the bottom of the mixin
@mixin respond($breakpoint) {
  @if $breakpoint == tab-land {
    @media (max-width: 75em) { @content }; //1200px
  }
   @if $breakpoint == tab-port {
    @media (max-width: 56.25em) { @content }; //900px
  }
   @if $breakpoint == phone {
    @media (max-width: 37.5em) { @content }; //600px
  }
  @if $breakpoint == big-desktop {
    @media (min-width: 112.5em) { @content }; //1800px //This has different rules than the rules above, ignore for now.
  }
}


2. Now we will instantiate that mixin in a different file using the @include function

 @include respond(phone) {
      font-size: 50%;
    }
    @include respond(tab-port) {
      font-size: 60%;
    }
    @include respond(tab-land) {
      font-size: 70%;
    }
    @include respond(big-desktop) {
      font-size: 80%;
    }
