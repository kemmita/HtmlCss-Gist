1. We can use rem to help us with resposnive desgin. this will keep us from having to write several different css querie size manipulation
code.
2. Use the html decleration box in your css file. Selecting to use font-size at 10 px is a personal decision, it can work differently.
By declaring our font size to 10px within the html decleration block we will be able to use rem throught the remainder of the CSS code. 
If we have a size value that we would typically use px for, we will now use rem, 10px = 1 rem. So whateverthe px value is, divide by 10. 
If we have padding of 30px, it would be 10/3 which = 3rem. 62.5% is 10/16. 16px = 100% by default on all browsers but we want ours to be 
10 px so that all of our rem calculations will work. So we will change 10px to 62.5% so that users zoom in and out continues to work. 
    html{
    font-size: 62.5%;
    }

.heading-primary-main{
    font-size: 6rem; // If you look at the coment above, you will see that this would translate to 60px
}


3. So now when the time does come to write css queries we need only to worry about chaning one selector, the property within and the 
decleration value. See below code for example


@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    html{
   font-size: 37.5%;
 }
}
